For Java applications, common CI steps include linting, testing and building. Linting can be done using Checkstyle which can be configured to a standard practice the team is using. Testing a Java application is typically done using Mockito framework which enables developer to do unit tests. Building a Java application involves a compilation step to generate Class files and package them into Jar files, ready to be deployed. Jenkins have been one of the more popular CI setups used by most companies but there are other platforms such as CircleCI and BitBucket. They all serve the same purpose to enable faster software development for teams collaboration. The CI setup is a standard set of procedures that has to be run before every code gets shipped to production. It is an automated system that catches issues to any new Pull Requests. Instead of relying on humans to run these steps one by one, we use CI/CD to repeat the pre-defined set of procedures to run and this enables developers to perform focus more on system designs and code implementations. This will help catch bugs and ensure a working deployable software is shipped to production and serving customers traffic correctly, ensuring the correct experience is delivered.
